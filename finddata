Baud rate of CAN: 1 Mbit/s
Needs some activity on CAN bus to switch to CAN mode
	What kind of activity?
		Any arbitrary data seems to work
A control frame sets all parameters of the talon at once
	10 ms control frame
Request device ID

Figure out the functions in CANSessionMux

g++ -Wall CANSessionMux.h CANSessionMux.cpp CanTalonSRX.h CanTalonSRX.cpp CtreCanNode.h CtreCanNode.cpp ctre.h test.cpp -std=c++0x

"cout <<" will try to print a uint8 as an ascii character

bytes over serial
1 byte length, 4 byte id, 4 byte period, 1..8 byte data
17 byte total

10 ms status frame 
	4th byte
		1st and 2nd bytes are limit switches

Talon SRX needs to receive a token to enable output
	heartbeat every 100ms? 
		jaguar does this
	2 bytes at beginning of control frame?
		CanTalonSRX has a  _TALON_Control_1_General_10ms_t struct with a space for 2 bytes of token (line 125)
	very little public documentation
	changing the control mode works
		change was reflected in 10ms control frame
